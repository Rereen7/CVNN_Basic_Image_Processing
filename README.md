Basic Image processing tasks using CVNN

1-Image classification example using CVNN

    Image dataset is CIFAR10, real-valued data is transformed to complex domain using Hilbert transform




2-mage Super-resolution example using CVNN
    Python re-implementation of SRCNN model using CVNN  repository: 
        https://github.com/NEGU93/cvnn
        
    Cited from SCRNN real-valued implementation:
        https://github.com/MarkPrecursor/SRCNN-keras

    Image dataset is T91:  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ll01dm/t91-image-dataset
    real-valued data is transformed to complex domain using Hilbert transform

    Implementation:
        script prepare_data.py is used to randomly prepare the dataset
        Run main_cvnn.py for training the model.
        change directory as needed in the code.
